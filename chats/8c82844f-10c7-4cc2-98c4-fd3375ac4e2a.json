      "content": "It seems like you are encountering a few issues while trying to use LM Studio. Let me address each error one by one:\n\n1. \"name 'enable_tools' is not defined\":\nThis error message suggests that the variable or function `enable_tools` is not properly defined in your code or configuration. To resolve this issue, please check the following:\n   - Make sure you have correctly imported any required modules or libraries.\n   - Verify that the `enable_tools` variable or function is defined and spelled correctly in your code.\n   - Ensure that you are using the correct syntax when referring to `enable_tools`.\n\n2. \"Invalid model identifier 'local-model'. Please specify a valid downloaded model (e.g., google/gemma-3-12b@q4_k_m, google/gemma-3-12b, gemma-3-12b-it).\":\nThis error indicates that the specified model identifier `local-model` is not recognized or does not correspond to a valid downloaded model. To resolve this issue:\n   - Double-check the model identifier you are using and make sure it matches one of the available models in your LM Studio.\n   - If you have downloaded a specific model, ensure that it has been properly installed and added to the list of available models in LM Studio.\n   - Refer to the documentation or guidelines provided by LM Studio for instructions on how to specify the correct model identifier.\n\n3. Repeated \"Error communicating with LM Studio: name 'enable_tools' is not defined\":\nThis error message appears multiple times, suggesting that there might be an issue with the `enable_tools` variable or function across different parts of your code or configuration.\n   - Carefully review all instances where `enable_tools` is used and ensure that it is properly defined and spelled correctly in each instance.\n   - Check for any missing imports or incorrect configurations related to the `enable_tools` functionality.\n\nTo resolve these issues, please carefully examine your code, configuration files, and model identifiers. Double-check for any typos, incorrect variable names, or missing dependencies. If you are still facing difficulties, refer to the documentation or seek further assistance from the LM Studio community or support channels specific to your setup.\n\nRemember to provide more details about your specific use case, including the programming language or framework you are using with LM Studio, so I can offer more targeted guidance if needed."
