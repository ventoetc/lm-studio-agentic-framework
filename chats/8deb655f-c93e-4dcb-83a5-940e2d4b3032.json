      "content": "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere and interacts with air molecules. Sunlight is composed of different colors that each have their own wavelength. Blue light has one of the shortest wavelengths in the visible spectrum, causing it to scatter more easily than other colors like red or green. As sunlight passes through our atmosphere, blue light is scattered in all directions by these tiny air molecules, making the sky appear blue when we look up.\n\nSunsets are red because of a similar scattering effect but with different circumstances. During sunrise and sunset, sunlight has to travel through more of Earth's atmosphere before reaching our eyes. This longer path means that shorter-wavelength colors like blue and green are scattered out of our line of sight, while the longer-wavelength colors like red and orange pass through relatively unscattered. Consequently, we see these warmer hues during sunsets.\n\nIn summary:\n1. Blue sky: Shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter more easily due to Rayleigh scattering.\n2. Red sunset: Longer path length causes blue and green light to be scattered away, leaving reds and oranges visible as the sunlight travels through Earth's atmosphere."
