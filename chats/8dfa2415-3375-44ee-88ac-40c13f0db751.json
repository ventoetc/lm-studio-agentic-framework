      "content": "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after British physicist Lord Rayleigh. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters air molecules and other small particles. Sunlight consists of different colors that have different wavelengths; shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter more easily than longer wavelengths (red). As the light travels through the atmosphere, blue light is scattered in all directions by the nitrogen and oxygen molecules present in the air, making the sky appear blue from our perspective on Earth.\n\nSunsets are red because of a similar scattering effect, but with different conditions. When the sun is near the horizon during sunrise or sunset, its light has to travel through more atmosphere than when it's overhead at noon. This longer path causes even more of the shorter-wavelength colors (blue and green) to be scattered out of our line of sight, allowing the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) to dominate the sky's appearance during these times. Additionally, dust particles and pollution in the atmosphere can enhance this effect by scattering light differently, contributing to the vivid reds and oranges often seen during sunsets."

      "content": "Daylight Saving Time (DST) varies by country and sometimes even within regions of a country. Typically, DST begins on a specific date in March or April when clocks are moved forward one hour to extend evening daylight into the summer months. It usually ends in November or October when clocks are turned back one hour.\n\nThe exact dates can differ from year to year and might vary by location:\n\n- In the United States, for example, DST generally begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November.\n- In the European Union, it typically starts on the last Sunday of March and ends on the last Sunday of October.\n\nTo find out the specific dates for your area or country, you would need to check the official guidelines or a reliable calendar that specifies DST changes. If you provide me with your location or country, I could give a more precise answer based on general practices in those regions."
