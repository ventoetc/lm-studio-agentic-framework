Let's double-check the spelling. The word is **strawberry**.\n\nLet\u2019s spell it again carefully:  \n**s t r a w b e r r y**\n\nNow, let's list the positions:\n- 1st: s  \n- 2nd: t  \n- 3rd: **r** \u2192 1st r  \n- 4th: a  \n- 5th: w  \n- 6th: b  \n- 7th: e  \n- 8th: **r** \u2192 2nd r  \n- 9th: **r** \u2192 3rd r  \n- 10th: y  \n\nWait \u2014 actually, let's check the correct spelling: **strawberry**.\n\nIt's: **s t r a w b e r r y**\n\nSo the letters are:\n- s\n- t\n- **r**\n- a\n- w\n- b\n- e\n- **r**\n- **r**\n- y\n\nSo we have **r** at positions 3, 8, and 9.\n\nThat\u2019s **three** r's.\n\nBut let\u2019s confirm:  \n- \"strawberry\" \u2014 yes, the word has **three** r's.\n\nFinal answer: **3**"
